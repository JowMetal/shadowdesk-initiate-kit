# SHADOWDESK™ INITIATE KIT

> *Welcome. If you’re here, you heard the call.*

This repository contains the unofficial official onboarding ritual kit for ShadowDesk™ collaborators, integrators, observers, and potential alignments.

It is **not a product.**  
It is **a process.**  
It is **an interface between intention and execution.**

---

## 📁 Contents

- `/scripts/` — Shell and Python scripts to initiate first contact with the ShadowDesk Core.
- `/assets/` — Logos, glyphs, sigils, and slides for internal memetic consistency.
- `/docs/` — Textual artifacts, onboarding documents, non-binding oaths.
- `/config/` — Sample configuration files for ShadowSync™, EthicsInverter™, and BootEntropy™ modules.
